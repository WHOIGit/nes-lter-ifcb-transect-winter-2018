associatedMedia	Unique URL identifier pointing to the landing page for the ROI in an external repository. Darwin Core term http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/associatedMedia. This is used to generate the occurrenceID.	character			NaN	Missing value
data_provider_category_HumanObservation	Category used by the data provider to name the organism for a manual identification, not necessarily a scientific name	character			NaN	Missing value
scientificName_HumanObservation	Name from a recognized taxonomic database (e.g., World Register of Marine Species, AlgaeBase) at the lowest level that matches the data provider category, for a manual identification as basisOfRecord.
