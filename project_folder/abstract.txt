These data represent the abundance and biovolume of taxonomically-resolved phytoplankton imaged continuously underway along the NES-LTER Transect during cruise EN608 in winter 2018. Images were obtained with an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) sampling at approximately 20-min intervals from seawater supplied from 5 meters water depth. Data are provided for the subset of images during the cruise that were on the north-south transect along longitude 70 53' W. Sizes for individuals were determined automatically by image processing, while identifications to morphological categories were done manually. Data are provided by taxon with names and machine-readable identifiers matched to the lowest taxonomic level to the World Register of Marine Species. Two data tables are provided: the level 1b for each occurrence and the level 2 that summarizes the occurrences by taxon per sample. Individual and sample identifiers are linked to images served by an external repository. This data package provides 144,281 machine-readable occurrences for incorporation into the Ocean Biogeographic Information System and the Global Ocean Observing System Essential Ocean Variable Phytoplankton biomass and diversity.
