    <abstract>
      <para>
  These data represent the abundance and biovolume of
  taxonomically-resolved phytoplankton imaged continuously underway
  along the NES-LTER Transect during the winter 2018 cruise EN608.
  Images were obtained with an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) sampling at
  approximately 20-min intervals from seawater supplied from 5 meters
  water depth. Data are provided for the subset of images during the
  cruise that were on the north-south transect along longitude 70 53’ W.
  Sizes for individuals were determined automatically by image
  processing, while identifications to morphological categories were
  done manually. Data are provided by taxon with names and
  machine-readable identifiers matched to the lowest taxonomic level to
  the World Register of Marine Species. Two data tables are provided:
  the level 1b for each occurrence and the level 2 that summarizes the
  occurrences by taxon per sample. Individual and sample identifiers are
  linked to images served by an external repository. This data package
  provides 144,281 machine-readable occurences for incorporation into
  the Ocean Biogeographic Information System and the Global Ocean
  Observing System Essential Ocean Variable Phytoplankton biomass and
  diversity.

            <title>Underway science seawater supplied to the imaging
  instrument</title>
            <para>
    Underway science seawater was supplied from 5-m water depth
    continuously during R/V Endeavor cruise EN608 using a diaphragm pump
    (gentler than an impeller pump for fragile cells). An Imaging
    FlowCytobot (IFCB) sampled at approximately 20-min intervals from a
    1 liter overflow bottle secured in a sink. The samples were
    pre-filtered at the intake using 150 micrometer nitex mesh to avoid
    aspirating overly large particles that might clog the system.
    Normally, the same IFCB unit samples from the underway for the
    entire cruise; however, we replaced the first IFCB (IFCB109) on the
    second day of the cruise due to a fraction of cells not being
    imaged.

    All underway samples from this cruise may be explored in the online

    Locations were determined for the IFCB samples based on matching the
    sample start time rounded down to the nearest minute to the ship
    position. We provide data for the subset of samples collected within
    1 km east or west of the NES-LTER Transect longitude 70 deg 53 min
    W, with code available in GitHub:
    https://github.com/klqi/EDI-NES-LTER-2019/tree/master/geographic_query.

            <para>
    We excluded samples taken at the beginning of the cruise with
    IFCB109 because an estimated 5-10% of cells were outside the field
    of view of its camera (there was evidence from the data that
    degassing was occurring due to the extreme temperature difference
    between the water sampled and the internal temperature of the IFCB).
    For the second IFCB (IFCB102) we confirmed there were no samples
    tagged bad_flow and checked the region of interest (ROI) x y plot in
    the IFCB dashboard at several time points. During the beginning of
    the cruise, IFCB102 was being used to check discrete samples from
    the underway science seawater, as a backup to the IFCB109.
    Ultimately, we also included 4 IFCB102 samples tagged underway and
    discrete to account for some of the excluded IFCB109 samples early
    in the cruise.

    Images in this dataset were triggered by chlorophyll fluorescence,
    thus mainly representing phytoplankton. IFCB trigger thresholds were
    set to image as wide a size range as possible, i.e., 5 to 150
    micrometers, with quantitative observations in a more narrow range.
    Images have resolution 2.77 pixels per micrometer.

    The IFCB draws in 5 ml per sample but does not image the entire

    Images were processed with software for segmentation and feature
    extraction to determine size parameters per ROI (IFCB Features
    Version 4). Results from image processing are provided in the IFCB
    dashboard per sample as a features_v4.csv file. We selected a subset
    of 4 features to provide per ROI (Area, Biovolume, maxFeretDiameter,
    minFeretDiameter). The biovolume calculation method is described by
    Moberg and Sosik (2012) https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2012.10.278.

    [WORKFLOW classification WoRMS_verify.Rmd and

  </para>
            <para>
    Identifications to morphological categories were done manually using
    annotation software with a database that also records the annotators
    and the number of times an annotation has been verified.
    Identifications are assigned per ROI, corresponding to an
    occurrence. We queried the database to export manual annotations for
    the geographic subset of IFCB102 samples and then further subsetted
    to include only those samples for which every ROI in the sample was
    verified by a high power annotator [- or - for which we have high
    confidence in the manual classifications - or - to reduce
    uncertainty]. Most of the morphological category names could be
    resolved to accepted taxonomic names and machine-readable
    identifiers in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). [The
    level of taxonomic identification varies, but some distinctive taxa
    can be identified to species level.] Some morphological categories
    could only be matched to WoRMS at a higher taxonomic level, for
    example mix_elongated is a morphological category of diatoms. Some
    morphological categories could not be matched to WoRMS, but were
    matched to Eukaryota in AlgaeBase. We also resolved taxonomic names
    and identifiers for the full list of categories in the annotation
    database, to be able to provide occurrenceStatus absent for those
    categories not observed in samples from this cruise. For the data
    product from this cruise, we also provide a higher classification
    group for each organism - diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes, or
    other than those 3 - to enable summarization for functional groups.
    Several categories are not organisms thus taxonomic names are
    NotApplicable (e.g., bubble, detritus). Code and classification
    lookup tables are available in GitHub:

            <para>
    Summarization per sample is possible because we are only providing
    data for samples for which every ROI had a manual annotation. Code
    for the summarization from the Level 1b to the Level 2 data table is
    available in GitHub:
    https://github.com/klqi/EDI-NES-LTER-2019/blob/master/plot1.
    Concentrations per taxon per sample may be calculated by dividing
    the abundance or biovolume by the volume imaged. Abundance does not
    match 1:1 to cell counts because chain- or colony-forming organisms
    may be imaged as a single ROI. Note concentrations will be
    underestimates for those taxa that do not always trigger
    fluorescence (e.g., heterotrophs). [For the data product from this
    cruise, we provide a concentration flag for categories undersampled
    when triggering only on chlorophyll fluorescence as reported by
    Brownlee et al. (2016) https://doi.org/10.3354/meps11687.]

    cleaning included: add lat/lon/depth to Level 1b, add depth to Level

      <abstract>
        <para>The Northeast U.S. Shelf (NES) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project integrates observations, experiments, and models to understand and predict how planktonic food webs are changing, and how those changes impact the productivity of higher trophic levels. The NES-LTER is co-located with the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem, spanning the Middle Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Maine. Our focal cross-shelf transect extends about 150 km southward from Martha’s Vineyard, MA, to just beyond the shelf break. Our overarching question is: How is climate change impacting the pelagic NES ecosystem and, in particular, affecting the relationship between compositional (e.g., species diversity and size structure) and aggregate (e.g., rates of primary production, and transfer of energy to important forage fish species) variability?</para>
